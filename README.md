## Concept

The game is a space shooter with a super overly dramatic / cheesy 80s style badass story.  


## Gameplay

* Space shooter style, enemies come from top of screen (galaga style)
* Multiple weapons types
* Upgradable Ship (?)
* Side missions

## Story Overview

### Level 1

* Player is attacking an enemy ship with a squad of guys
* Player's ship is nearly fully upgraded
* Player meets his three handlers
  * His commander
  * A technical advisor for his ship
  * A cute nurse who monitors his vitals 
* Suddenly a huge ship with a massive plasma cannon destroys the whole squad
* player crashes into an abandoned planet

### Post Level 1 cutscene

* Oh shit player is alive!?
* Commander tells him that the giant plasma is coming straight for earth!
* Player gets up, nurse warns him against it 
* Player is too badass to listen
* Finds a crashed ship, and fixes it up
* Flies back into space 

### Level 2

* Player fights enemies in space with his new shitty ship
* Ship talks to player, is a huge smartass
  * Ship is a cargo ship and isn't meant for combat
  * Voices his displeasure at this
* Ship malfunctions sometimes
* Player finds giant spider boss and does a brief boss battle (but it gets away)
* Ship unlocks new dodge ability


### Level 3

* Player enters an asteroid field.  Now needs to fight enemies and dodge asteroids
* Ship continues being a smart ass
* At the end, the player catches up to the giant spider boss and fights it
* Also unlocks an upgrade module, so player can pick what component to upgrade

### Level 4

* Player fights through more waves of enemies 
* Unlocks a missile weapon for his ship

### Level 5

* Player fights through more enemies.  Some enemies can only be destroyed with bombs.
* Fights a new boss that has parts that can only be destroyed with bombs
  * Also that somehow utilizes the dash attack

### Level 6 

* Ship continues being a smartass 
* General tells you that you're getting close, but you're entering the dark zone 
* This level is spent in super darkness, fighting enemies
* Fight a giant robot snake boss at the end (that you fight in the dark)
* Unlock double blasters

### Level 7

* Level is filled with extra tiny enemies that kamikaze you
* Come to an area where oxygen is limited
* player goes unconcscious
* Ship is a smart ass, but despite hating you, he revives you
  * "Don't think its because I like you.  I just don't want us to die"
* Player unlocks Magnetic Blast, which repels all projectiles back to enemies

### Level 8

* More space shooting
* Fight boss which doesn't take any direct damage, only from projectiles 
  * Requires using the magneto blast

### Level 9 

* More space shooting
* Nurse tells you "something fishy is going on.  Watch your back"
* Ship tells you he doesn't trust any of those people
* Unlock Remote bomb

### Level 10

* More space shooting lol
* fight a boss that requires detonating remote bombs into a tricky weak spot 
* recieve a space transmission from the main villian of the game
* He eggs you on, tells you to come get him with your weak pathetic excuse for a ship
* The ship takes offense to this, says "lets kick his ass" or whatever
* Ship is starting to warm up to you
* Also, unlock a shield

### Level 11 

* This level takes place close to the sun.  Heat slowly damages your ship, requiring you to collect health pickups constantly
* Player unlocks a plasma cannon that only works 3 times per level (?)
* Nurse tells you that she has to tell you something
* She says that before she tells you, you have to know that she's in love with you
* ...but she's also rigged your ship to self destruct
* She gets shot by someone off screen and dies

### Level 12

* A timer begins.  The player needs to destroy the ship before it reaches earth
  * Also before he self destructs
* The general reveals that he was the one who shot the nurse
* He commends you for making it this far
* The general was working for the main villian the whole time
* You were never meant to survive this long
* The technical advisor also chimes in
* That giant ship youre chasing is HIS CREATION!
* Ship chimes in, says he thinks he can disable the self destruct, but you cannot take any damage at all
* Not a problem because there's not enemies around right
* Two freaking ships appear
* The general says "Do you like our fancy war ships?"
* Him and the technical advisor laugh
* Fight the two ships, and have to not take any damage at all or you die (the shield helps here)
* Kill the two ships
* Your ship is now determined, and is like "Lets go kick this guys ass!"

### Level 13

* This is it.  The final battle. 
* Earth is in the background.  You must destroy the final massive big ass ship
* Sometimes it'll shoot missiles towards the earth, you have to shoot them down
* You are requried to use the right weapon in the right situations, all gameplay mechanics are used 
* Destroy ship 
* Your ship gets hit with debris
* The ship's AI chip was damaged, so your ship can't speak very well. 
* You go spiralling out of control
* Crash into the earth
* The ship is mostly destroyed, but the ship manages to say "It was an honor...friend" or something dramatic
* Ship goes offline
* Player freaks out, is very upset
* Smashes fists against the ship
* Suddenly ship comes back to life
* Says something smart ass like "Please do not hit me, who do you think i am!?"
* Player flies away from earth into space, happily ever after
* Credits roll
